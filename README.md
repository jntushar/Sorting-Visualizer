Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here: http://sortingvisualize.herokuapp.com/
